# Apply sliceTCA to your data
We made a user-friendly sliceTCA library that you can find at [https://github.com/arthur-pe/slicetca](https://github.com/arthur-pe/slicetca).

In particular, the [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arthur-pe/slicetca/blob/master/sliceTCA_notebook_1.ipynb) is a good place to start as you can easily swap-in your data.
